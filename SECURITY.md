# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities to iam-py-test@protonmail.com<br>
I am currently working on setting up more security, so later this document will be updated<br>

### Valid issues
I consiter pretty much all issues to be worth hunting for (although none have bounties)<br>
Some rules:
- attacking GitHub or Microsoft websites does not fall under this policy (their websites fall under their policies)
- trying to compromise any of my accounts (GitHub, ProtonMail, etc) is out of scope
- be aware that I DO NOT control the backend, so issues with that fall under Microsoft's policy
- any Denial of Service, DDOS, damaging the server it's self, or website defacement is off limits
- any physical attack against myself or Microsoft is out of scope and may result in legal action
- attacks only possible when the attack ALREADY HAS ROOT ACCESS on the user's device are probably off limits (the attack has already won)
- any attempt of sending phishing or malware to me or Microsoft employees (or anyone else really) is OFF LIMITS
- any attempt to attack my personal/work devices is out of scope except in rare circumstances (please ask for permission beforehand)  
- exploits in GitHub are not totally off limits, but should be reported to GitHub NOT me
- please do not report anything other than security issues as a security issue
