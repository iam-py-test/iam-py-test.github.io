<h1>Page Not Found (404)</h1>
    <div>
      <p id="myfault">
      <p>Oh no! It looks like this page does not exist or has moved.</p>
  This can happen if I move or delete a page but the link you clicked was not updated, my site is experencing a problem, or maybe you made a typo (typos do happen).<br>
  No matter what happened, it is not your fault.</p>
  Here are some links to help you find what you are looking for:
  <p hidden id="back"></p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/iam-py-test">My GitHub profile</a></p>
  <p><a href="/mirrors">Mirrors of various lists</a></p>
  <p><a href="/friendly-waddle">My blog (not much there)</a></p>
  <p><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404">Wikipedia about 404s</a></p>
  <h4>If the page you are looking for is not here, <a href="/">try going back home</a></h4>
  <p>If every page on my site returns a 404, please <a href="https://github.com/iam-py-test/iam-py-test.github.io/issues">open an issue (or click here)</a></p>  
  <br><br>
  <p>I hope you find the page you were looking for.<br> Note: if you go to 404.html, it will always return this message even thought it exists</p>
