    <h2>Google Analytics is spyware</h2>
    <p style="color:red">This is not complete</p>
    <P>
      For those who don't know, Google Analytics is a program created by Google to allow website owners to see who is visiting their site and what those people are doing.<br>
      According to Wikipedia, spyware is "<code>software with malicious behavior that aims to gather information about a person or organization and send such information to another entity</code>".<br>
      Google Analytics tracks what users (that's you) are doing on a website, and tracks you across the internet.<br>
      Just loading the Google Analytics script sends your IP address (an id for your device which is used to load websites), your geolocation (even if you denied location permission), your device and browser fingerprint (which can be used to idenfify you even if you clear your cookies, use an private browsing window, or use a VPN), 
      and - if you are not in a private browsing window - your cookies too. <br>
      Once loaded, the script tracks what pages you visit and what links you click. <br>
      This is all done without the user's consent and knowledge, and all of this data is sent to the website owner and Google. <br>
      Some websites inform you in their Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy, but these do not trump explicit user consent. Some websites also put that in their cookie consent banner.<br>
      To use the website, the user must agree to the Terms (even if you don't click the <i>Agree</i> button, you agree by using the website - even thought you probably did not know that) to use the website.<br>
