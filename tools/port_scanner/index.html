<h2>Port scanning test</h2>
		<div>
			A simple browser-based port scan of your local computer, to see what ports are exposed to websites. This <b>can not</b> tell what is on those ports or if it can be exploited. Be aware that scanning a large number of ports will take time and may slow down your device.
