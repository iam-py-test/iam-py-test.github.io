            <a href="https://easylist.to/#easylist">EasyList</a> is a filterlist designed to remove ads from international websites. Part of how EasyList works is using cosmedic filters to hide part of websites, and some of these filters apply to all websites. This Proof of Concept downloads the list of those filters, creates elements which will be hidden by them, and then sees if those elements were hidden.<br>
            This is <i>not</i> an "exploit" or an original idea, it is just a more automated type of what many real websites already do.
