    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div>
      I am an independant security researcher, malware analyist, and filterlist maintainer. My main filterlist is The malicious website blocklist, though I also co-maintain DandelionSprout's Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool<br>
      I don't really have a record for vulnerabilities reported, as none of the ones I have reported have been fixed yet.<br>
      I often report minor issues (i.e. typos, broken links) to project and website maintainers, but don't really have a record of that<br>
      My pronouns are He/Him

    <h3>Technical skills</h3>
    <div>
      I can program pretty well in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, Batch, and Python <br>
      I can do some programming in Bash and VBS, and know a small amount of C. <br>
      I have written browser extensions and know a fair bit about them, including enough to find some vulnerabilities in them<br>
      I also know a bit about Web Dev and servers <br>
      I do malware analysis and research scam and phishing websites, so I know a bit about that too<br>
      I know my way around Windows and Linux (mainly Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, Kali, and the ChromeOS Linux environment) using both the GUI and command line, and a fair bit about the user-friendly side of iOS and ChromeOS<br>
      My interest in cryptography extends for many years, although I am no expert and fail to solve some basic challenges.<br>
      A new thing is figuring out <i>"hacking"</i> tools like nmap and BeEF
