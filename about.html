    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div>
      I am an independent security researcher, software developer, malware analyst, and filterlist maintainer. My main filterlist is The malicious website blocklist, though I also help maintain DandelionSprout's Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool<br>
      I have found <a rel="noopener" href="https://hackerone.com/iam-py-test?type=user">a few minor security vulnerabilities</a>, but nothing major. Mainly, I hunt down Windows malware and scam websites.<br>
      I often report minor issues (i.e., typos, broken links) to project and website maintainers, but do not really have a record of that<br>

    <h3>Technical skills</h3>
    <div>
      I can program fairly well in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Batch, Bash, and Python 3.<br>
      I can do some programming in VBS, Powershell, PHP, and Windows JScript, and know a (extremely) small amount of C. <br>
      I have written browser extensions and websites.<br>
      I do malware analysis and research scam and phishing websites in my spare time.<br>
      I know my way around Windows and Linux/Linux-based systems (Microsoft Windows 10/11, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, Tails, Kali, and Google ChromeOS) using both the GUI and command line, and a fair bit about the user-friendly side of iOS<br>
