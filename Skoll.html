<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><p>On 2025-8-9, a college student
received an email from &quot;contract@trep-trepiu.com&quot; with the
subject &quot;STUDENT GRANT&quot;.<br/>
The domain &quot;trep-trepiu.com&quot;
appears to be owned by the Italian designer door company TREP+.<br/>
The
&quot;to&quot; field shows the <span style="font-weight: normal">email</span>
&quot;support@grants.com&quot;. This is likely because the recipient
was blind carbon copied on the email. According to its website,
grants.com is “a platform that helps individuals, businesses, and
organizations find and apply for grants”. grants.com appears to
legitimate, and unrelated to this scam.</p>
