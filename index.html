  The U.S. Congress<sup><a href="#note1">[note]</a></sup> may be on a road to passing the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/15/kids-online-safety-act-kosa-senate/">[1]</a><a href=""></a></sup>.<br>
  Proponants of this legislation claim it is to protect children, but experts warn it will have the opposite effect. However, protecting children is not the intent of KOSA; this law exists for the sole purpose of silencing LGBTQIA+ people<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kids-online-safety-act-lgbtq-youth">[2]</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/senator-appears-suggest-bipartisan-bill-will-censor-transgender-conten-rcna103479">[3]</a></sup>.<br>
  Despite this, it has gained disturbing support from Democrats<sup><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjven5/elizabeth-warren-just-backed-an-online-safety-bill-that-will-harm-lgbtq-youth">[4]</a></sup> and even (supposed) allies of the LGBTQIA+ community<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4469721-schumer-backs-updated-kids-online-safety-bill/">[5]</a></sup>.<br>
  If you live in the U.S., please contact your legislators and tell them to oppose KOSA.<br>
