  <h1>Oppose the Kids Online Safety Act</h1>
  The United States Congress<sup><a href="#note1">[note]</a></sup> may be on a road to passing the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), and the Senate passed it on 2024-7-30<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/15/kids-online-safety-act-kosa-senate/">[1]</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.techdirt.com/2024/07/26/kosa-will-come-to-the-senate-floor-on-tuesday-senators-paul-wyden-explain-why-its-still-bad/">[2]</a><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4792890-senate-passes-bills-kids-online-safety/">[3]</a></sup>.<br>
  Proponants of this legislation claim it is to protect children, but experts warn it will have the opposite effect. Moreover, protecting children is not the intent of KOSA; this law exists for the sole purpose of silencing LGBTQIA+ people<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kids-online-safety-act-lgbtq-youth">[4]</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/senator-appears-suggest-bipartisan-bill-will-censor-transgender-conten-rcna103479">[5]</a></sup>. This legislation will deprive children of their rights, and harm adults ability to use the internet. <b>All children should have a right to free speech and uncensored access to information</b>.<br>
  Despite this, it has gained a disturbing amount of support from Democrats<sup><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjven5/elizabeth-warren-just-backed-an-online-safety-bill-that-will-harm-lgbtq-youth">[6]</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/26/pass-it-pass-it-pass-it-pass-it-pass-it-the-president-says-about-a-bill-the-gop-says-will-be-useful-to-silence-lgbtq-voices/">[7]</a></sup> and even (supposed) allies of the LGBTQIA+ community<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4469721-schumer-backs-updated-kids-online-safety-bill/">[8]</a></sup>.<br>
  If you live in the U.S., please contact your legislators and tell them to oppose KOSA.<br>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p id="note1">Note 1: In the United States, Congress is a bicameral legislature consisting of the House and the Senate. Each "state" has two people in the Senate (called Senators), and as such there are 100 Senators. Legislation must pass both the House and the Senate, but the Senate can preform some actions on it's own, such as confirming presidental appointments.</p>
