<h2>Why you should switch to Linux</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Trust</li>
      Linux is open source, which means that <i>anyone</i> can view its source code, and millions do. This means that if Linux was stealing you data, everyone would know.<br>
      While allowing anyone the ability to view the source sounds like it would help malicious hackers, it does not. Just having the source along does not allow someone to hack Linux, 
      and it is likly that someone could figure out how to hack it without the source. Determined hackers can obtain the source of closed source software as well, and many have learned how to hack it anyway
      
      <li>Easy software managment</li>
      In most Linux distros (OSs based on Linux), you can use a Package Manager to install almost everything you need, and easly uninstall it or update it. This is one thing (for me)
      that made Linux far better than Windows; on Windows, if you wanted to install software, you had to go to an website, download it, run the installer, and hope its not malware.<br>
      Linux lets you install software with one command: <code>sudo apt install </code>
      
      <li>Its free</li>
      Linux is free to install, and (unlike Windows & MacOs) does not require you to sign a 90 page license. This is because partually most of Linux is under no or limitted copyright.<br>
